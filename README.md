### I initiated a project for AtliQ Grands to use "Business and Data Intelligence" to tackle their declining market share and revenue in luxury hotels. The aim is to make smarter decisions based on data and regain their competitive position in the hospitality industry.


### AtliQ Grands is using "Business and Data Intelligence" to make smart decisions by analyzing past data, even though they don't have an in-house data team. The goal is to improve their standing in luxury/business hotels.

## Objectives:

#### Smart Planning: Get useful information for better plans, understanding what customers want, and staying ahead of competitors.

#### More Revenue: Find ways to make more money and use specific strategies to keep growing.

#### Stay Competitive: Get back customers and beat competitors by making smart choices based on trends and what others are doing.

#### Work Better: Use insights to make internal processes smoother and improve how the whole hotel chain works.

#### This project is all about AtliQ Grands sticking to their promise of giving guests a great experience. By using data a lot, they want to be a top choice for luxury/business hotels, keeping up with what customers want, and staying successful in the hotel industry.
